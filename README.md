* Select generic ESP32 board in arduino IDE for compiling the code
* The sensor used is SW-18010P vibration sensor that is packaged with 3 wires.
* VCC is provided using 3v3 port
* Ground is provided with ground
* Digital input goes into pin 15.

## For App: 
* Make sure you pair the ESP32 via bluetooth with your phone prior to searching for the connections
